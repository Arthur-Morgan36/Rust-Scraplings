# rust_scraplings

## Concept
This repo is dedicated for me to share what I call my "Rust Scraplings" since the Rust files consist of small functions that have no correlation with each other.
This is mainly meant to be used as a way for me to track my progress throughout my years of writing Rust code.

You **shouldn't** grab anything from here and use it in your own project as there's a very high chance there's a faster, more efficient and concise way of accomplishing the said task.

## Other
*Well why didn't you make it private if it's just for you to track your progress?*

If I need to share a file with someone to get any feedback around my code it's available to me with a simple link. Besides what would github be without sharing code?

â†’ Any feedBack around my Rust code is appreciated to allow me to progress.

---
PS; there's no `src` folder or a `main.rs` file because each function is not meant to be ran in a collective file. As I've said; they aren't linked in any way and their applications vary.
